# polymer-small-data

Source of data used: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/neurips-open-polymer-prediction-2025/data. I am not sure if we are allowed to upload ```train.csv``` here, so to be on the safe side, we won't upload it here.. Please join the Kaggle competition and download it there!

TODO

1. model-based FI (SHAP analysis?)
2. uncertainty assessment (especially useful, given small data)
3. learning curve
4. example notebooks that are clean
